# EVENT-REGISTRATION-SYSTEM
Event registration system using QR Code.
This code defines several functions to implement the event registration system with QR code functionality. The register_for_event() function generates a unique registration code for the user and creates a QR code for it. The check_in_with_qr_code() function reads the QR code image provided by the user and uses the registration code to look up the user's registration information in the database. It then marks the user as checked in.
